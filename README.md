The (UNAM) Is the largest Mexico’s educational institution, being primarily responsible of attending the demands of the country’s and population’s demands of education in the Mexico valley Area (Which is constituted primarily for the Mexico City and Mexico State provinces).


The main goal of this study is to compare the proportion of UNAM students given the population of the Mexico City and Mexico State provinces (which are the one’s where said institution have the must faculties) throughout the years. This can help us estimate the growth of the academic availability given the demands of the Mexican population. The UNAM’s data was obtained from https://www.estadistica.unam.mx/series_inst/index.php, in “otros” (others) section, as “_Población escolar de 1924 a 2024_”; the excel file is included here as "_unam_pe_desde_1924.xlsx_". The population's data was obtained from https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/descarga/?t=123 , a site from the Instituto Nacional Estadistica y Geografia (National Institute of Statistics and Geography).
